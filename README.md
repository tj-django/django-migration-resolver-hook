# [django-migration-resolver-hook](https://pypi.org/project/django-migration-resolver-hook/)

Django Migration resolver ensures that migration files always stays ordered regardless of remote changes.


Problem:

With generated migration files using Django's `manage.py makemigrations` command you could run
into issues where the generated migration files would potentially be out of sync with 
remote's default branch most CI servers are able to catch this error by running a test based on
your local branch merge back into the base branch there by spotting duplicate migration nodes.


Solution:
   
This package aims to solve this problem by using a Doubly Linked List while traversing the app's 
migration file(s) detecting duplicate node(s) and potential conflicts.

When duplicate nodes are detected [`stat.st_mtime`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stat.html#stat.ST_MTIME) is used to sort files based on the last modified time.

:warning: This is not always accurate and might require a manual check to validate changes.

> NOTE: This doesn't require Django's installed apps concept when using 
*CLI commands* since this is totally file based and should be executed within
 the root/app folders.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install django-migration-resolver-hook
```

##### Poetry

```bash
poetry add -D django-migration-resolver-hook
```


## Usage

#### Use Case

##### Remote
```text
|--- migrations
       |---- ...
       |---- 0007_auto_20200112_2328.py # Shared between remote and local repo
       |---- 0008_auto_20200113_4328.py # Only exists on remote
       |---- 0009_auto_20200114_4532.py
       |---- 0010_auto_20200115_1632.py

```

##### Local repo

```text
|--- migrations
       |---- ...
       |---- 0007_auto_20200112_2328.py  # Shared between remote and local repo
       |---- 0008_auto_20200114_5438.py  # Only exists locally which raises duplicate migration nodes errors.
```

> Since this is now out of sync with the remote branch to sync changes:
-----------------------------

:warning: Unstable use [Static migration resolver](#using-static-migration-resolver) instead.

### Using Auto migration resolver

---------------------------------
#### CLI command: `auto_migration_resolver`

Auto detect and fix migration files by providing the following:
- `--app-name`: The app_name of the Django application.
- `--strategy`: The strategy used to resolve migration errors (options: "reseed"/"inline"). (Defaults to: "reseed")
- `--exclude`: The list of migration files that should be ignored.
- `--commit`: Perform a `git commit` for the changes after moving file old -> new.
- `--verbose`: Verbose command execution.

##### Usage:

```bash
$ auto_migration_resolver --app-name my_app --commit --verbose
```

###### Output

```text
...
```

-------------------------------
### Using Static migration resolver

-------------------------------
#### CLI command: `migration_resolver`

Fix migrations by providing the following: 
- `--app-name`: The app_name of the Django application.
- `--last`: Last migration file of the remote that should be the seed of the conflicted migrations with or without the suffix.
- `--conflict`: The migration file which needs to be reseeded from the last migration file.
- `--commit`: Perform a `git commit` for the changes after moving file old -> new.
- `--verbose`: Verbose command execution.

##### Usage:

```bash
$ migration_resolver --app-name my_app --last 0010_auto_20200115_1632 --conflict 0008_auto_20200114_5438 --commit --verbose
```

###### Output

For more options


```bash

```
usage: migration_resolver [-h] [--auto-detect] [--verbose] --app-name APP_NAME --last LAST --conflict CONFLICT [--commit]

Resolve duplicate migration nodes.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --auto-detect        Auto-detect and fix migration errors. (Not supported)
  --verbose            Verbose output
  --app-name APP_NAME  App Name
  --last LAST          The glob/full name of the final migration file.
  --conflict CONFLICT  The glob/full name of the final migration file with the conflict.
  --commit             Commit the changes made.
```


Using vsc (git/mercurial) when the remote has a migration files that conflict with previous
migrations you have locally.


TODO:
- [x] Auto detect and resolve errors with migration nodes.
- [ ] Speed up execution using async/await for handling reading nodes.
- [ ] Add support for database unapply migration for case of applied migrations.
- [ ] Add support to rollback any changes if there are failures in the chain of operation.
- [ ] VCS support right now only git is supported (extend to mercurial).
- [ ] Document Auto migration strategies.
